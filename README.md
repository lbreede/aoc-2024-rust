My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) 2024 in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I was encouraged to use in [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) after
reading [this blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/11/29/advent-of-code-in-rust-for-the-rest-of-us/)

# Template for solving Advent of Code puzzles in Rust with RustRover

Read the [blog post](https://blog.jetbrains.com/rust/2024/11/29/advent-of-code-in-rust-for-the-rest-of-us/) that
explains the structure and rationale behind this template.

## Usage

1. Create a new project from the template repository:
    - Using GitHub’s templating feature: Simply click the Use this
      template [button](https://github.com/new?template_name=advent-of-code-rust-template&template_owner=bravit) on the
      repository page, create a new repository, and then open it in [RustRover](https://www.jetbrains.com/rust/) by
      selecting *File | New | Project From Version Control…*.
    - Adding the template to RustRover: You can integrate the template directly into RustRover and use the regular New
      Project wizard.

2. Whenever you're ready to start solving a new day's puzzle:
    - Open the `bin` folder, copy and paste the `NN.rs` file into it, and give it the corresponding name (`01.rs`,
      `02.rs`, etc.).
    - In the `input` folder, create and fill the input data file (`01.txt`, `02.txt`, etc.).
    - Fill in the `DAY` constant in the freshly created file.
    - Run the current day's solution to check if it compiles (you can use the gutter icon next to the `main` function).
    - Fill in `<TEST-INPUT>`.
    - Write the expected answer for the test data in the `assert_eq` statement in *Part 1*.
    - Now you're ready to write your solution in the `part1` function (inside `main`).
    - Use `Shift+F10` (Win/Linux) or `Ctrl-R` (macOS) to re-run the same program.

3. When you're done with the first part of the puzzle, use folding to hide *Part 1*.

4. Uncomment *Part 2*, fill in the test data assertion, and start solving it.
